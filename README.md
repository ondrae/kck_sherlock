Kansas City, Kansas is a really cool town. They also just started doing a lot of work to open up the cities data. To celebrate that effort, I made a quick art project on top of that open data.

### Inspired By
This really cool example from Young Hahn, http://alistapart.com/article/hack-your-maps.
I forked his repo, then added in Kansas City, KS places from this file http://www2.wycokck.org/gisdata/shp/poi_pt.zip

### How to contribute
You could make this story better by changing the places around if you felt like it. It would probably be cooler to make a brand new one though.
1. Go to Project Gutenberg and get an cool story in public domain, http://www.gutenberg.org/
2. Fork the original repo at https://github.com/mapbox/tutorial-sherlock
3. Add in your text and places. Redo the drawings too if you feel like it.

### Open Data in Kansas City, KS

Kansas City, KS just adopted an Open Data resolution. More legislation coming soon.
