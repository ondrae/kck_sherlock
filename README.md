Kansas City, Kansas is a really cool town. They also just started doing a lot of work to open up the cities data. To celebrate that effort, I made a quick art project on top of that open data.

## Inspired By
This really cool example from Young Hahn, http://alistapart.com/article/hack-your-maps.
I forked his repo, then added in Kansas City, KS places from this file http://www2.wycokck.org/gisdata/shp/poi_pt.zip
